Notes to help do fiddly processes without bumps.

TILED - new tilesets (not as easy as it would seem)
-create tileset in Tiled from multiple images.
-create a tilemap of exactly the right size to contain one of each of the tiles from the tileset.
-export this tilemap as a .png.
-create a completely fresh tileset from the single image tilesheet (with the same gridsize). (!Important!)
-load this tileset into your map tileset.
-embed the tileset.
-export map as .json
